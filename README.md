# PyTorchCPP
## Matplotlib C++
I am using lava/matplotlib-cpp located at
![MatplotlibCPP](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp)

## Explanation
I developed a C++ version of PyTorch which is built off of the Python.h header library. This library is designed for stock/crypto price forecasting but can be used for many other applications not limited to Finance. A neat feature of this library is it counts the amount of time it takes for the Neural Network to train, and also makes testing easy by providing gaetways to convert data between PyObject and C++.
